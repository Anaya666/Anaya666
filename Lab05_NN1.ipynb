        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will use `PyTorch` to implement manually a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for three different tasks: binary classification, multi-class classification and regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "## General instructions to complete in ALL three tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ***IMPLEMENTATION***:\n",
        "   \n",
        "Implement a separate class for each task:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `BinaryMLP` for the binary classification task  \n",
        "  - `MultiClassMLP` for the multi-class classification task  \n",
        "  - `RegressionMLP` for the regression task\n",
        "\n",
        "   Each class must include the following methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `__init__` for initializing 1 or 2 hidden layers.\n",
        "  - `forward` to transfer information from the input to the output layer.\n",
        "  - `cost` computing the cost.\n",
        "  - `fit` for training, using autograd and manual updates. **Use stochastic gradient descent to update your weights**. *N.B.* You may probably reuse much of the code we used in this week tutorial already.\n",
        "  - `predict` to convert the information at the output layer into the required output.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. ***DATA PREPARATION***\n",
        "\n",
        "For each task, you will be provided with a toy dataset. For each dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Split into training and test sets (use an 80/20 split)\n",
        "  - Standardize the features properly, avoiding data leakage\n",
        "  - Convert all data into `PyTorch` Tensors for compatibility\n",
        "\n",
        "3. ***MODEL TRAINING AND EVALUATION***\n",
        "\n",
        "Instantiate the model for each task and train it under different hyperparameter configurations. In each case, record the performance on both the training and test sets using the appropriate metric for the task (accuracy, MSE, etc.). You should explore the following configurations:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - One hidden layer, varying the number of hidden units (use ReLU as their activation function)\n",
        "  - Same number of hidden units across one or two hidden layers (use ReLU as their activation function)\n",
        "  - Repeat the above setups using Tanh activation instead of ReLU\n",
        "\n",
        "Present your results in a compact way (e.g. a summary table, a data frame etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE**: When training your model, use a fixed learning rate of your choice (e.g., 0.01 is a reasonable starting point) and a reasonably large number of  epochs (e.g., 100–200) based on how training and test performance evolve.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. ***REFLECTION AND DISCUSSION***\n",
        "\n",
        "Reflect on the impact of the different hyperparameter settings:\n",
        "\n",
        "- How does the number of hidden units affect performance?\n",
        "- What changes when using two layers instead of one?\n",
        "- How does the activation function (ReLU vs. Tanh) influence results?\n",

        "   - Label = 1 → [0, 1, 0]  \n",

        "- How does the number of hidden units affect performance?\n",
        "When using the ReLU activation function, model performance initially improves as the number of hidden units increases from 5 to 20, reflected by slightly higher training and testing accuracies. This suggests that adding more units initially helps the network learn richer representations of the data. However, when the number of hidden units increases to 50 and 100, both training and test accuracies drop sharply. This likely indicates overfitting or unstable training, as larger networks can become harder to optimize and may require smaller learning rates or more regularization.\n",
        "In contrast, with the Tanh activation function, performance improves more steadily as the number of hidden units increases from 5 to 50, showing that moderate model complexity helps capture more non-linear patterns. However, at 100 hidden units, both training and testing accuracy slightly decline, suggesting diminishing returns and possible overfitting.\n",
        "Overall, both activation functions show that increasing hidden units improves performance up to a point, after which accuracy either plateaus or decreases. Moderate network sizes (around 20–50 hidden units) seem to provide the best balance between model flexibility and generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- What changes when using two layers instead of one?\n",
        "When using the Tanh activation function, performance improves as the number of hidden units increases from 5 to 20, for both one and two hidden layers. Both training and test accuracies rise slightly, showing that increasing model capacity helps capture more patterns in the data. However, at 50 units per layer, accuracy begins to decline marginally, suggesting that additional complexity does not necessarily translate to better generalization. The difference between one and two hidden layers is relatively small, though the two-layer models tend to perform just slightly better overall.\n",
        "In contrast, with the ReLU activation function, accuracy improves up to 20 hidden units but drops sharply at 50 and 100 units. This pattern suggests that the larger ReLU networks may be overfitting or experiencing vanishing gradient issues, leading to poor learning stability.\n",
        "Overall, moderate network sizes (around 20 hidden units) consistently yield the best results for both activations. Tanh shows more stable and consistent performance across, while ReLU is more sensitive to the number of hidden units, especially as the network grows deeper or wider.\n",
        "\n",
        "- How does the activation function (ReLU vs. Tanh) influence results?\n",
        "The activation function strongly influences how effectively the model learns and generalizes. In this experiment, models using Tanh achieved more stable and consistent performance as hidden units increased, with both training and test accuracy improving gradually before leveling off. In contrast, ReLU models performed well with fewer hidden units but showed a sharp decline in accuracy for larger number of hidden units, likely due to issues such as dead neurons and unstable gradients. Overall, Tanh led to smoother learning and better generalization across network sizes, while ReLU was faster initially but less reliable as model complexity increased.\n",
